# Diagnose-Diabetes
The "Diagnose Diabetes" project focuses on the early detection of diabetes mellitus, a chronic metabolic disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. The goal is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a patient is likely to be diabetic based on a set of medical attributes.

The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains records of 768 female patients aged 21 and above. Each record includes eight health-related features such as glucose level, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), insulin level, and others, along with a binary outcome indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of diabetes.

To address this classification problem, the data undergoes thorough preprocessing, including handling of missing values, feature scaling, and balancing of class distribution. A Random Forest Classifier is used for prediction due to its robustness, high accuracy, and ability to handle nonlinear relationships.

The model is evaluated using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and visual tools such as confusion matrices and feature importance plots. Additional data visualizations, including heatmaps and pairplots, help to understand the relationships between features and their influence on the diagnosis.

This predictive model serves as a practical tool to support early diagnosis of diabetes, potentially aiding healthcare professionals in timely intervention and treatment planning. The approach demonstrates how machine learning can contribute to preventive healthcare and data-driven medical decisions.
